## About Me

I am Ganmin Yin, currently a Ph.D. candidate (2020-2025, expected) majoring in GIScience at Peking University. I am also a research assistant in the Spatio-Temporal Social Sensing Lab ([S<sup>3</sup>-Lab](https://geos3.netlify.app/)), supervised by Prof. [Zhou Huang](http://faculty.pku.edu.cn/huangzhou) and Prof. [Yu Liu](http://faculty.pku.edu.cn/liuyu). Before that, I received my B.S. Degree on GIScience at Peking University in 2020. 

My research interests focus on urban analytics with geospatial big data and deep learning techniques, including sustainability issues like **transportation and urbanization**. My research goal is to introduce state-of-the-art theories and models to better understand the human-environment relationship.

Besides, I am also very interested in Hiking, Traveling, and Literature :ï¼‰.
